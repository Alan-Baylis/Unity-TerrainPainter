TerrainPainter is a splatmap generation tool based on GPU computing.


Features :
- paint rules (height, slope, masks etc.)
- mask generation (flowmap, convexity, concavity, aspect, texture map)
- compatible unity's terrain system.
- custom terrain shader :
   > triplanar mapping
   > height blending
   > tiling reduction


Using Asset :

1- Create TerrainPainter_Splat prototype in project panel.

2- Create a game object. And add TerrainPainter_Manager component.

3- Add TerrainPainter_Splat prototypes to TerrainPainter_Manager component.

4- Click on image you want to edit. Parameters tab will be opened.

5- After that just tweak parameters to see effect.


For adjusting tiling size, use TerrainLayer tileSize and tileOffset paramters.
